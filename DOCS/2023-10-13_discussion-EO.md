### To EO, PR:
> As discussed yesterday, here is the paper by Florian Lemarié et al about his ABL: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/543/2021/
I wonder if their fig. 3 can answer your question maybe? The ABL1D is like an additionnal layer between atmospheric reanalysis and the ASL bulk module. The ASL bulk module  thus remains the one talking to SI3 and OCE, unlike in a normal coupling situation with OASIS, i guess?
And here is how the talking is done with SI3 step by step:
 (cf section 3.3)?
I hope this help!
In any case, would you mind telling  me again which surface process you wondered if it was still included or not when the ABL is on?
cheers
Stephanie
